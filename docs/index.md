The LoRa paw is an addon for the USB Nugget, giving it LoRa capabilities. It's based on the RFM95W module from HopeRF.

Interfacing with the LoRa paw is extremely easy, as libraries are available both in [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_RFM9x) and [Arduino](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa).

You can order one today from [our store](https://retia.io/products/lora-breakout-for-usb-nugget).
